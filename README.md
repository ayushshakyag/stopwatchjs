<h1>Stopwatch</h1>
This is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2>Features</h2>
Displays hours, minutes, and seconds
Start, stop, and reset buttons
Disables the start and stop buttons as required

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the stopwatch, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Once the page is loaded, you can use the start, stop, and reset buttons to control the stopwatch.

<h2>How it works</h2>
The stopwatch works by using JavaScript to update the hours, minutes, and seconds displayed on the page. The start button starts a timer that updates the time every second. The stop button stops the timer, and the reset button resets the time to zero.
